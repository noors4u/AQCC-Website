      We are a Budding Cricket Club in Tokyo, Japan, contains a group of Cricket players with deep love, passion and enthusiasm for the game of Cricket. AQCC- Alqha Quashers-Yokohama Cricket Club Team is having mix cultural of India, from South to North, & show integrity in Worlds of Ninjas - Japan.

      Desperate Cricket players with so much passion towards the game, were left around with less options when in Japan. Thus there was a start of our club back in 2012, bringing together the players with same passion towards this gentleman game. We are a thriving cricket club in the east Japan (Kanto region). We have members in numbers and diversity.

      We represent JCL (Japan Cricket League) and KCL (Kanto Cricket League) in Japan. We have a professional coaching committee whose role is to improve the standards of the players through continuous practice sessions held during weekends of almost all seasons of the year except winter. We do have a fund raising committee, which enables us to get the sponsorship.

      If you are interested in being involved at our Club in any way – as a player, coach or sponsor, please get in touch – you would be made very welcome.

      Please either contact the relevant person from the ‘Contacts’ section of this site.
